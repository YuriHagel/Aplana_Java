The usedelimiterString pattern method sets the delimiter of this Scanner object This delimiter will be used by scanner object to tokenize string This is helpful if we are using Scanner to split String into multiple tokens This method is necessary specially in dealing with files as a data source I have used this method a lot in splitting delimited strings coming from flat files Legacy systems usually saves it’s data in files separated only with string patterns to separate the fields One good example on the usage of this method is in parsing csv files CSV files are usually delimited with line break per row and semicolon for columns Thus the use of useDelimiterString pattern will be helpful on this scenario
